Gathered up my dotfiles so I don't have to completely remake them every time I change machines

Things of note:
- These are dotfiles. If you've hit your head and can't 
  figure out why you're not seeing them try using `ls -a`
- Symlink to these, it makes management easier
  (e.g. `ln -s /path/to/original /path/to/link`)
